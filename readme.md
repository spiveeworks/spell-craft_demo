========

Basics
------

move with wasd, cast spells by left clicking on-screen

SpellCrafting
-------------

the following keyboard buttons form a grid:

tyu
ghj
bnm

think of these as 'levels' for the RGB values of your current spell,
additionally the size of the spell is controlled with the next column:

i
k
,

these controls will change the color and size of the spell in slot 0,
the slots 1-9 and 0 can all be loaded by pressing the corresponding keys,
additionally you can save to slots 1-9 (but not 0) by holding shift while
  pressing the corresponding keys

Once you have some spells you like, you can start right clicking to add
  your spells to a 'cluster buffer'.
When you press `=`, the spells saved in the buffer will be turned into a
  cluster-grenade type spell which will cast all the spells that were in
  the buffer. (try it!!!!)


Examples
========

Medium purple spell:
press in order, g, n, u, k, 0, then left click somewhere on the screen

RGB triangle:
press 0, k, and then
  t, n, m, right click above yourself,
  b, y, right click down and to the right from yourself,
  n, m, right click down and to the left from yourself,
  press =, then left click somewhere to make little triangles of explosions!
press shift + 1 to save your work.

Oh and the cluster spells nest arbitrarily
